# 👋 Hey, I'm Saara 
  
## Currently looking for a junior position   
I have finished my Full Stack Web Development studies @Business College Helsinki early 2023.  
Did my 6 months internship as Front-End Developer intern @Liana Technologies.   
   
Studies included basics of JavaScript, HTML and CSS, React, Node and TypeScript.  
In group project ([movesapp](https://github.com/SaaraLeppis/movesapp) in my repositories) we have learned to use 
- GIT in softwaredevelopment 
- [SCRUM](https://www.scrum.org/) and what are the responsibilities of different roles
- work managamnet tools (e.g. [Trello](https://trello.com/en)) 

And of course we learned a lot how to work in a team.   

I have also gained experience of system integrations from @Saranen Consulting Oy's Integration Academy program in 2023. 
  
I am proud of gaining  6 ects of  [Full stack open 2022 -course](https://fullstackopen.com/) to get more practice, recently (2/2024) I finished the [TypeScript part](https://github.com/SaaraLeppis/full-stack-open-9_2023)
