# 👋 Hey, I'm Saara 
  
  
I study Full Stack Web Development @ Business College Helsinki. Program started in August 2021 and ends in December 2022.  
  
  
We have studied basics of JavaScript, HTML and CSS, React, Node and TypeScript.  
In group project ([movesapp](https://github.com/SaaraLeppis/movesapp) in my repositories) we have learned to use 
- GIT in softwaredevelopment 
- [SCRUM](https://www.scrum.org/) and what are the responsibilities of different roles
- work managamnet tools (e.g. [Trello](https://trello.com/en)) 

And of course how to work in a team. 
  
  
Currently I am looking for an internship place and doing [Full stack open 2022 -course](https://fullstackopen.com/) to get more practice! 

Here, in GitHub, I have basicly school projects and assigments.
